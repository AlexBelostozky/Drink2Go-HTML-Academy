## Statement of work
Only Figma UI design and specification was originally given.


And my task was to create the **adaptive HTML layout** for mobile, tablet and desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari friendly) **within only 7 days** using:
- **BEM** methodology
- **Less** preprocessor
- **image adaptation** for screens with different DPI
- **Gulp** automatisation
- **PixelPerfect** precision
- **validate the form** before sending it to the server (check the existence and length of the comment) (currently implemented using **HTML5**)

Within 7 days **I worked on the project for 62 hours**. The points of the specification that I managed to complete during this time below:

- [x] adaptive layout
- [x] BEM methodology
- [x] adaptive images
- [x] accessibility of the navigation menu in the mobile version when JS is disabled
- [x] form validation
- [ ] implementing the slider in promo section using swiper.js library
- [ ] implementing the map section using Leaflet library
- [x] custom select input
- [x] different hover, focus, active, and disabled states of button and input elements

The project is currently under review. After the review, I will post the results here.
